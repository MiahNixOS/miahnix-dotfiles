  I am done mopping! Well, it did take me a good couple of hours, but I did also wipe down some of the walls that had gunk stuck on them. Plus I did the doorway by the side door and even hit all the floor boards at least a little bit. And at least it's almost over now! Woot! Only 37 more minutes! I can do it!
