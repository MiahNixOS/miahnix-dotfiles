Home For Lunch!

Well, it is 00:39 and I think I clocked out at 00:10 for lunch.
I should really be heading back already, but it is getting more
and more difficult each day. This place is just really getting
on my nerves! I mean by the time I get to doing anything, I have
to turn around and go back, it's freakin' ridiculous. And now
they are getting on me about cutting off Teri's answering thing.
Bah! Well, I have to go back and finish this night, I will have
to "Hold on for one more day!"
