  I am glad I got my neovim setup decently well! Now I just need to get these fuckers at TB to get off my ass! *laughz* I don't know why, but for some reason I have been irritated with the way that they ask me or tell me to do things. Especially the people that aren't even shift leads like Nikki and Ray tryin' to tell me what to do and stuff... Aggritatin'! And like I said, Keith is cool and all, but they should have made me a shift lead before him. They are failing me time and time again!
